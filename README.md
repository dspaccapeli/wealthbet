# Wealthbet
_Final project for the Interaction Programming class_

This app is developed under a course at KTH. It is an app that let you search for investment opportunities after a small quiz and presents way of adding them to your virtual portfolio.

## How to run the app

There are two ways of trying this app:
- Via Expo
- Build and run on your own

### Via Expo

1. Navigate to the [Wealthbet app page](https://expo.io/@community/native-component-list) where our demo is hosted:

2. If you have Android ü§ñ

    1. Download th Expo Client on your device ([Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www))
    2. Open the Expo Client app and scan the QR Code on the page
3. To run it on the browser üåç, click "__Open project in the browser__" and use the browser simulator. You may have to wait some time in the queue since it is a free service.
4. If you want to run it on iOS üçé, you can build the project and run it (_see the next section_).

### Build and run on your own
 
 1. Clone the repository.
 2. Install Expo with ‚Ü¶ 'npm install expo-cli --global'.
 3. Execute ‚Ü¶ 'npm install' in the root folder.
 4. Create one file called '_IEXToken.js_' with the following content (for the TAs ask us if necessary):
 
        export const token = "YOUR_IEX_CLOUD_TOKEN_HERE";
 5. Execute ‚Ü¶ 'npm install' in the root folder.
 6. Execute ‚Ü¶ 'expo start' in the root folder.
 7. Follow the instructions and run it either in the simulator or your Expo Client app after you have logged in on both:
    
    1. Login on the smartphone app by creating an account on [Expo](expo.io).
    1. Login on the command line tool by executing ‚Ü¶ 'expo login'.


## Next steps to do

- Make all the content from the fund appear from API calls
- Style the app to make it look nicer
- Refine the UX and user journey

### Implemented layouts

- The layout for the proposed screen is there, but not styled beside small tweaks.
- There's one API call from the Fund screen.

## Project structure

The following is the structure for the component we developed:

    components
    |
    --- DevNavigationFooter.js
    |
    screens
    |
    --- CalculatorScreen.js
    |
    --- FundScreen.js
    |
    --- PortfolioScreen.js
    |
    --- PresentationScreen.js
    |
    --- QuizScreen.js
    |
    styles
    |
    --- util.js
    |
    App.js
    DataModel.js
    (IEXToken.js)
    
üó∫ DevNavigationFooter.js is an helpful components that lets you test all the screens of the app without navigating to each of them one by one.

üì± The 'screens' folder contains the code for each of the individual screens/views of the app.

üé® The 'styles' tab contains common styling resources.

üß† 'App.js' is the entrance point of the app and is where the routing is instantiated.

üìà 'DataModel.js' contains the data model for the app and manages API call on behalf of the components.
